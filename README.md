## Daniel Gawne's Portfolio Website

[This](https://www.dgawne.com) is my personal portfolio page. It includes tabs for a homepage, history of projects, resume, and contact information. The website is written in React.js and utilizes a minimum number of packages to avoid dependency deprecation. As of right now the site uses [react-mdl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-mdl) for some style bootstrapping, but I hope to move to either [material-components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) or a custom layout/nav solution in the future.

I have worked to make the site as accessible as possible, with guidance from the WebAIM Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool and corresponding documents. If you run into any trouble using the site, please feel free to open an issue!
